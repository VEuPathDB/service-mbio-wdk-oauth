# Each entry in the 'hosts' map is an array of container definitions that depend
# on access to that host.  The entries in the list should be the names of the
# dependent containers as defined in the primary docker-compose 'services' block
# or blocks.
#
# The 'hosts' map keys MUST be "host:port" pairs.
